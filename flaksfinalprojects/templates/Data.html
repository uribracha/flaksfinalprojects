    <h3>Climate change is a problem that, if left untreated, can seriously harm the human race</h3>
    <p>
        costal cities will be sunk and destroyed by the rising sea, crops growth will fail becuase extreme weather condition and could cause great famines and great fire and terrible storms could destroy homes and devestate cities 
    </p>
    <p>
        So what can be done? Climate change is caused by greenhouse gases like CO2 and Methane. Most of our electricty is generated from oil and coal that when burned emit greenhouse gas. this project pourpose is to analyse countries greehouse gas emmition  throught many years so that we could see which countries are the most energy efficent. to that end I used a csv file from the OECD that shows greenhouse gas emmition of OECD countries and some that arn't in the OECD like China. 
    </p>
    
    <p> 
But monitoring greenhouse gas emmition alone isn't enough. We have to factor in population and population growth over time. The more population a country have the more greenhouse gas it wil emit. Therfore to look at grennhouse gas emitions correctly we must facor in population. The second file of my datset is a csv file that shows every country population count (mantianed by the UN). i sliced the data so that i would have only the relevent years and countries of my other data file.    </p>
